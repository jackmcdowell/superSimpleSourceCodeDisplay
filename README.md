# superSimpleSourceCodeDisplay
This super simple source program uses the php show_source function and some CSS to display the source code of a page (including php makup) when a button is clicked.

I wanted to show my source code on my portfolio, but since I code in PHP most of the options I found would simply print out the source code that the browser itself sees, making a foreach loop for instance seem like increadibly lazy html writing.

This tiny project borrows from https://css-tricks.com/make-a-view-source-button/ and not only significantly cuts down on their code, but also allows server code to be displayed. 

It goes without saying, but make sure that you don't print out any passwords or sensitive includes!
